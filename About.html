   Hello, dear visitors!<br>My history<br> Something about me.I live in Russia in the city of Voronezh. I am study at Voronezh State University.
    My future profession - the programmer. I am to take pictures of 14-15 years, approximately.<br>
  One day, my grandfather gave me a digital camera, and I was so fascinated by
      the nature of the shooting, animals, people, and everything that was around me.
     I realized that I want to do this more seriously.<br>
     My tools<br>  Now I have the Canon 1100D camera and a pair of lenses.
